Startups in the sector raised $1.4bn, according to Dealroom, as VCs cottoned onto opportunities to gamify experiences for avid fans, build sports communities and provide deeper performance analytics for both amateurs and professionals. While the $592m picked up by startups in the sector so far in 2023 is unlikely to hit the heights seen last year, plenty of companies have convinced VCs — and a number of professional sportspeople themselves — to part with their cash. Germany’s eGym, which provides gyms with software and equipment, raised €207m in July. Smaller rounds have also rolled in for Lenus eHealth — a startup that helps personal trainers start a business — which raised €26.8m in May and fantasy football game GOALS, which raised $20m in April following a $15m seed round in 2022. But which sports tech startups have investors got their eye on at the moment? To find out, Sifted spoke to VCs from Boost Capital Partners, Active Partners and Moonfire Ventures.
