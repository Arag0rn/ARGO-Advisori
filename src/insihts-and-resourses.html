          <h3 class="articles-list-head-main">11 sports tech startups to watch, according to investors</h3>
          <p class="articles-list-text">VCs from Boost Capital Partners, Active Partners and Moonfire Ventures share their picks
            2022 was a record year for sports tech funding in Europe. Startups in the sector raised $1.4bn, according to Dealroom, as VCs cottoned onto opportunities to gamify experiences for avid fans, build sports communities and provide deeper performance analytics for both amateurs and professionals.
            
            While the $592m picked up by startups in the sector so far in 2023 is unlikely to hit the heights seen last year, plenty of companies have convinced VCs — and a number of professional sportspeople themselves — to part with their cash.
           Germany’s eGym, which provides gyms with software and equipment, raised €207m in July. Smaller rounds have also rolled in for Lenus eHealth — a startup that helps personal trainers start a business — which raised €26.8m in May and fantasy football game GOALS, which raised $20m in April following a $15m seed round in 2022.
            But which sports tech startups have investors got their eye on at the moment? To find out, Sifted spoke to VCs from Boost Capital Partners, Active Partners and Moonfire Ventures.

        <h3 class="articles-list-head-main">Birkenstock Public Fundraising, what’s this IPO about? From modesty to extravaganza.</h3>
          <h4 class="articles-list-head">Story of the company 2 years older than the USA itself. What is Birkenstock’s unique selling point? </h4>
          <p class="articles-list-text">
            Why does it matter, many will ask? After all, it’s just a commodity product. Yet, it’s more than that, just like Nike, it has succeeded in branding, although more impressively it has succeeded at branding without having a catch phrase “just do it” – a phrase in its original meaning was much darker than what it became known for, since that was the phrase used by the prisoner that was dealt a death sentence.
          </p>
          <p class="articles-list-text">
            He just wanted to be done with “it”. Birkenstock’s problem statement can be defined as follows: “People suffer from foot pain caused by uncomfortable sandals, so we’ll give you footwear that enables high comfort and therefore better quality of life.” Its history goes back, in fact, way back. It’s 2 years older than the United States, founded in 1774. Started by Johann Adam Birkenstock in Langen Bergheim, what’s today’s suburban Frankfurt, quickly gained local fame for making comfortable shoes for the vibrant working community of the oldest German cities.
          </p>

            <p class="articles-list-text">
            Birkenstock stayed as an SME for a long time, until the ’60s when Counterculture and happiness became a thing, and it started to be recommended by many orthopaedics as a go-to shoe for those seeking comfort. Yeah, it kinda discriminates against the flatfooted, with its extremely arched design, but I guesssomething’s gotta give. It was such an important part of the counterculture that even the great Steve Jobs wore Birk’s if he wore a shoe at all. 
            </p>
            <p class="articles-list-text">
            The funny thing is that earlier in the year somebody bought that very shoe for around $220,000. A rather emotional purchase, I shall say. Fast forward to 2021, after numerous attempts by outsiders to get into the company, the Louis Vuitton-backed private equity firm, L Catterton, was successful at acquiring it. At the time it was considered a staggering price of $4.3B. Forwarding another 2 years, on October 2023, we are on the day of the Birkenstock IPO, with a target valuation of $9.3M on a fully diluted basis, over 2.1x MOIC in 2 years. 
            </p>
            <p class="articles-list-text">
            Not unheard of, but not a bad result either, especially considering the times, one of the toughest IPO periods in a decade. The company is shooting to raise $1.5B in the NYSE, and the capital is going to be used as follows: $500M for paying down debt which stands at xxxThe rest is the cash to the PE, per FT. The roadshow for the IPO must’ve been a success, at least, although it was posted by the PE backer, LVMH by placing an order for $325M of the total IPO. The World’s largest sovereign wealth fund, from Norway, will pick up another 20%or $300M while partnering up with Durable Capital Partners.
            </p>
            <p class="articles-list-text"></p>
            I  expected at least 80% of the IPO would be subscribed before the first trade occurs leaving room for$150M to be freely picked up by the retail. As far as the valuation of the business, as mentioned, it’s expected to be $9.3B.
            
            <p class="articles-list-text">
            Let’s examine that. We have revenue CAGR at 18% last 10 years, which accelerated since the PE takeover. We have debt of $1.9B but once netted with cash that’s at $1.6B. With an average of 37% FCF margin, and revenue growth of 12% for the next 5 years and 8% for the 5 years after that, I arrive at the total FCF of $8.4B. but thatneeds to be discounted for the cost of capital, for taking a risk to invest in a single firm, which I estimate it at around 9%. That brings that 10 year FCF estimate at a present value to $5.5B. 
            </p>
            <p class="articles-list-text">
            I calculate the terminal value via GGM to be around $5.5B as well with a LT growth of 4%. To add all the components up: 10 year FCF of 5.5BTerminal Value of 5.5BNet Debt of -1.6BGives a net equity value of $9.4B which is surprisingly in line with what the market expects.
            </p>
            <p class="articles-list-text">
            The only thing it reveals to me is that investors expect an average of 10% revenue growth for the next 10 years, and if you think that the revenue growth ofthe last few years can be replicated, this IPO might be worth following.
